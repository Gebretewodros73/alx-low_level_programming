# Project Description: Hash Tables in C

Welcome to my hash table project in C! In this project, I am working with hash tables and I have gained a good understanding of the following concepts:

- Arrays: Hash tables are typically implemented using arrays, so I am comfortable with working with arrays in C.

- Pointers: In C, pointers are used to manipulate memory addresses, and I am using pointers to interact with the hash table's array.

- Memory allocation: Since the size of a hash table is not known beforehand, I am using dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory for the array.

- Hashing functions: I am writing a good hashing function that produces minimal collisions, which is used to convert a key into an array index.

- Collision resolution: When two keys hash to the same index in the array, a collision occurs. I am understanding how to resolve collisions, either through chaining or open addressing.

- Retrieval and insertion: I am implementing the ability to insert and retrieve values from the hash table.

Working with hash tables in C can seem overwhelming at first, but with practice and experience, I am becoming more comfortable with these concepts. I hope to continue to improve my skills in this area and create efficient and effective hash tables.
